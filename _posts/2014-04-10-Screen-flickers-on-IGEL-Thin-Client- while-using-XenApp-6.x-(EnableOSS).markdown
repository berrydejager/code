When you experience flickering of certain (in our case on blueish) parts of an internet website which being connected to a XenApp 6.x farm using a IGEL Thin Client you might need to read these Citrix articles :

[CTX133935 - Flickering or Other Display Issues Might be Seen when Adaptive Display or Progressive Display is Enabled](http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX133935) and [CTX128332 - Images are Tinted Blue in Published Photoshop](http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX128332)

This can easily be eliminated by setting the following setting in the setup of the Linux thin client:

    IGEL Setup -> System -> Registry -> ICA -> wfclient -> enableoss -> â—˜ Enable off-screen drawing.

Unthicking this setting eliminates the problematic progressive / adaptive display feature when using OSS (Off-Screen Surfaces).
