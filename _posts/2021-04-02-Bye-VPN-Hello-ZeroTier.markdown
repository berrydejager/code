## What is ZeroTier?

ZeroTier is a smart Ethernet switch for planet Earth.

Itâ€™s a distributed network hypervisor built atop a cryptographically secure global peer to peer network. It provides advanced network virtualization and management capabilities on par with an enterprise SDN switch, but across both local and wide area networks and connecting almost any kind of app or device.

## Why choosing ZeroTier?

It has everything you need;

* It is open source
* A free, no purchase/creditcard registration, plan 
* A vast variety of platform support
* API enabled, see https://docs.zerotier.com/central/v1/
* HashiCorp's Terraform intergration

# How does it work?

# What did i use?

* VMWare ESXi 6.7 as a hypervisor platform
* ZeroTier account, which is free
* a Linux Mint 20.3 virtual machine at the local location
* a Linux Mint 20.3 virtual machine at the remote location
* Creating a ZeroTier network between these two VMs

# How to use the setup?
