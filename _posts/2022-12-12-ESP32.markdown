# Why

# What is it

# What do I use?

* Linux workstation; Pop!_OS
* Visual Studio Code, while using plug-ins;
    * PlatformIO

# Getting started

Connect the board using data/sync micro-USB to a workstation. I tried various cables a the `/dev/ttyACM0` didn't always show up with every cable.

Check if the cable is correct and the communication port is present in the `/dev/` folder

    ls -l /dev/tty*

When the correct cable is used a `tty` device, in my case `ttyACM0` is added to the list of devices.

To write to the `ttyACM0` device the current user needs to be added to the `dialout` group.

    sudo adduser $USERNAME dialout

Log out and log in again to make the group effective.

## Arduino IDE

## Visual Studio Code
Now install the Visual Studio Code and the plugins.

* [PlatformIO IDE](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)

__Important Notice:__ Working with VScode combined with PlatformIO tests your patience; take a coffee, take the dog out for a walk, enjoy a deep meditation session and everything will be fine. __Do not click around too much just leave it be__
